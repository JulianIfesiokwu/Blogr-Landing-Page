### What I learned
These are a few things I learnt, the project was quite complex but enjoyable.

How to break down CSS into small media query defined files. Very important as it help me understand the order of CSS links in HTML, and how individual CSS files interact with one another.

How to make a dropdown show on hover.

How to create modals.

How to edit svg images. There are many ways to do this.

Padding cannot take a negative number but margin can. I also learnt alot of how to use negative margins, how elements can overlap padding but not margins.

How to make svgs responsive. How? open the file in n editor and delete the width and height of the svg. Then the img dimensions is editable with CSS.

COOL! Remember, to make svgs responsive, open the svg in vscode to view the svg code, then remove the height and width embedded in the code. 

USing overflow-x: hidden to remove horizontal scroll bars.

Background-image is used to add mutiple background.

Code I am proud of
.details-image picture img{
    margin-left: -40%;
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}

This was used to move one of the images to the left, combined with overflow-x:hidden I was able to achieve the effect required.

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about svgs. Its quite complicated and too much time during my project.
